Title: Comparative Analysis of Pre-processing Methods for House Price Prediction

Description:
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of a dataset pertaining to house prices. The dataset has been processed using two distinct pre-processing methods: Training 1 and Training 2. Each method employs different models and parameter configurations, allowing us to compare their performance and identify the optimal approach for accurate price prediction.

In Training 1, non-integer data is transformed into integer values, while Training 2 utilizes the "get.dummy" function to convert non-integer data into Boolean representations. By employing these contrasting pre-processing techniques, we aim to determine the method that yields the highest accuracy in predicting house prices.

The obtained results are meticulously compared and evaluated. This comparative analysis sheds light on the effectiveness of different pre-processing methods, models, and parameter settings in achieving the most accurate price predictions. By identifying the optimal combination of pre-processing, model selection, and parameter configuration, we aim to provide valuable insights for accurate house price prediction.
